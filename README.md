## Project Overview

This project illustrates the use of align-content and justify-content properties within CSS Grid. These properties control the alignment of grid items along the grid container's block and inline axes. By manipulating these properties, we can achieve various alignment effects such as starting, centering, ending, and distributing space between and around items.

# Properties Demonstrated
- **Align-Content:**

  - start
  - center
  - end
  - stretch
  - space-between
  - space-around
  - space-evenly

- **Justify-Content:**

  - start
  - center
  - end
  - stretch
  - space-between
  - space-around
  - space-evenly

## Features
- Visual examples of each `align-content` and `justify-content` property.
Responsive design to demonstrate behavior at different viewport sizes.
Simple and clean UI to focus on alignment effects.
